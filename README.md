# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-using-Flask-and-ML

Here comes the ultimate project of machine learning based web app which is Face Recognition Based Attendance system . 

Here we are simply running the flask app using the 'flask run' command .

As it is a fresh run , there are 0 users in database.

Lets add a face/user.

Now we can see that now , the number of users in in our database become 1.

Now lets add one more face from internet.

Now lets start taking attendance...

As we can see that user's name along with the 'student id' is being showed on the frame.

As soon as I close this window by hitting 'esc' key , the student's attendance will show up in the frame !!

And here it is ...

The student's attendance contains the name , id , and time at which the attendance was marked !!

Let's another attendance,,,

And here is the second attendance also

So in this way we can use this project to mark the attendance of the students easily .

Hope you liked the project .
