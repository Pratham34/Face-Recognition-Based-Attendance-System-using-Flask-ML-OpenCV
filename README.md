# 🎯 Face Recognition-Based Attendance System 🎓

A smart web-based attendance system using Face Recognition technology, built with OpenCV and Flask. This system automatically marks attendance by identifying student faces and records them into an Excel sheet in real-time.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to streamline the attendance process. The system detects faces using OpenCV, captures facial data, trains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, and identifies students during real-time webcam capture to mark their presence.
